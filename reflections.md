## What did i learn?

I learned a few things during this lesson

- general use information about the terminal
- logging into GitHub through the terminal
- pulling out a file and edit it in Code and then "push" it out back to github

## What is Terminal / Why Care?  

The terminal is a way to access different functions of your computer,  while not being the most intuitive thing *(people have gotten use to GUIs)* offers much more versatility in the different things you are able to do. That you might not be able to do on your typical GUI layout simply because those options aren't in the GUI, this provides much more control over what you want to do.

## What is GitHub/Git and Why?  

GitHub at its core is a code repository, simply a place to store your code that isn't on your own hard drive or something, but it also adds **much much more**.

1. The Ability to revert your code
2. The ability to easily share your code with others
3. Automated tests that detect conflicts if multiple users are editing a file and more!

## How would these tools help a developer?  

There are certainly many features that would help developers on github, if they are a solo developer it is a place to store your code and easily make changes/revert to previous iterations if something happens to be broken in the latest update. And if they are part of a group working together it provides a fantastic way to share the project and make sure that their are no conflicts between the different people writing the code.
